# Electronic-Modules
This project provides a set of electronic modules designed for hands-on learning and experimentation with analog signal processing circuits. The modules are built on printed circuit boards (PCBs) using widely available commercial components, making them accessible, robust, and easy to use in both academic and non-specialized environments.
